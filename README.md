# movieList-Firebase
 Add movies to the app using Firebase

IMPORTANT NOTE: 

const appSettings = {
    databaseURL: "https://realtime-database...firebasedatabase.app " <<<=YOUR URL GOES HERE 
}

Substitute this databaseUrl with your very own fitebase realtime database url to see the changes in your database. Leaving this as such will only add or remove things to my database and you will not be able to see any changes in your firebase database.

If you have any doubts about creating the firebase datatbase ,please refer to the Youtube
